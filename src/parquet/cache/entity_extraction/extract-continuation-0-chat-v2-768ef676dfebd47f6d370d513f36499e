The king's son never left her side, and kept paying her the\nmost flattering attentions. The young lady was nothing loth to\nlisten to him; so it came to pass that she forgot her godmother's\ninjunctions, and, indeed, lost her reckoning so completely, that\nbefore she deemed it could be eleven o'clock, she was startled at\nhearing the first stroke of midnight. She rose hastily, and flew\naway like a startled fawn. The prince attempted to follow her, but\nshe was too swift for him; only, as she flew she dropped one of her\nglass slippers, which he picked up very eagerly. Cinderella reached\nhome quite out of breath, without either coach or footmen, and with\nonly her shabby clothes on her back; nothing, in short, remained of\nher recent magnificence, save a little glass slipper, the fellow to\nthe one she had lost.\n\n\nCINDERELLA DANCING WITH THE PRINCE IS ADMIRED FOR HER\nGRACEFULNESS. THE CLOCK STRIKES TWELVE: SHE HAVING FORGOT HER\nGOD-MOTHER'S INSTRUCTIONS, IS ALARMED, FLIES OUT OF THE\nBALL-ROOM--HER GORGEOUS APPAREL IS CHANGED INTO THE DRESS OF A\nCINDER-WENCH, AND HER SPLENDID EQUIPAGE INTO A PUMPKIN, RATS, MICE\nAND LIZARDS.\nThe sentinels at the palace gate were closely questioned as to\nwhether they had not seen a princess coming out; but they answered\nthey had seen no one except a shabbily dressed girl, who appeared\nto be a peasant rather than a young lady.\nOn this second night, as you have taken notice, dazzled by\nworldly show and the pleasing flattery of her royal lover,\nCinderella over-stays her time, and is compelled to make her way\nback to her father's house on foot and in rags—an everlasting\nlesson to all the pretty little Cinderellas in the world to keep\ntheir word, and to act in good faith by such as befriend them.\nNever mind—her heart is in the right place—she is a\ncharming good creature; and although virtue goes home in rags, it\nwill leave some token behind—some foot-print by which it can\nbe known and traced wherever it has once walked. We shall hear from\nthat little lost glass slipper again!\n\n\nCINDERELLA RETURNED SHABBILY DRESSED.\nWhen the two sisters returned from the ball, Cinderella asked\nthem whether they had been well entertained; and whether the\nbeautiful lady was there? They replied, that she was; but that she\nhad run away as soon as midnight had struck, and so quickly as to\ndrop one of her dainty glass slippers, which the king's son had\npicked up, and was looking at most fondly during the remainder of\nthe ball; indeed, it seemed beyond a doubt that he was deeply\nenamored of the beautiful creature to whom it belonged.\nThey spoke truly enough; for, a few days afterwards, the king's\nson caused a proclamation to be made, by sound of trumpet all over\nthe kingdom, to the effect that he would marry her whose foot\nshould be found to fit the slipper exactly. So the slipper was\nfirst tried on by all the princesses; then by all the duchesses;\nand next by all the persons belonging to the court; but in vain. It\nwas then carried to the two sisters, who tried with all their might\nto force their feet into its delicate proportions, but with no\nbetter success. Cinderella, who was present, and recognized her\nslipper, now laughed, and said, \"Suppose I were to try?\" Her\nsisters ridiculed such an idea; but the gentleman who was appointed\nto try the slipper, having looked attentively at Cinderella, and\nperceived how beautiful she was, said that it was but fair she\nshould do so, as he had orders to try it on every young maiden in\nthe kingdom. Accordingly, having requested Cinderella to sit down,\nshe no sooner put her little foot to the slipper, than she drew it\non, and it fitted like wax. The sisters were quite amazed; but\ntheir astonishment increased tenfold when Cinderella drew the\nfellow slipper out of her pocket, and put it on. Her godmother then\nmade her appearance; and, having touched Cinderella's clothes with\nher wand, made them still more magnificent than those she had\npreviously worn.\n\n\nTHE HERALDS OF THE COURT ANNOUNCE THE PROCLAMATION THAT THE\nPRINCE WOULD MARRY THE LADY WHOM THE GLASS SLIPPER FITTED.\nCINDERELLA TRIES ON THE SLIPPER, WHICH FITS HER DELICATE FOOT, TO\nTHE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF HER FAMILY.\nHer two sisters now recognized her for the beautiful stranger\nthey had seen at the ball; and, falling at her feet, implored her\nforgiveness for their unworthy treatment, and all the insults they\nhad heaped upon her head. Cinderella raised them, saying, as she\nembraced them, that she not only forgave them with all her heart,\nbut wished for their affection. She was then taken to the palace of\nthe young prince, in whose eyes she appeared yet more lovely than\nbefore, and who\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CINDERELLA<|>PERSON<|>Cinderella is a young lady who attended the court ball and captured the attention of the king's son)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING'S SON<|>PERSON<|>The king's son is enamored with Cinderella and seeks to marry her)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GODMOTHER<|>PERSON<|>Cinderella's godmother provides magical assistance to Cinderella)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALACE<|>GEO<|>The palace is where the king's son resides and where the proclamation for marriage is made)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BALL-ROOM<|>EVENT<|>The ball-room is where Cinderella dances with the prince and loses track of time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLIPPER<|>EVENT<|>The glass slipper is a key item in the story, used to identify Cinderella)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDERELLA<|>KING'S SON<|>The king's son is enamored with Cinderella and seeks to marry her<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDERELLA<|>GODMOTHER<|>Cinderella's godmother provides magical assistance to Cinderella<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDERELLA<|>PALACE<|>Cinderella is taken to the palace of the young prince<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDERELLA<|>BALL-ROOM<|>Cinderella dances with the prince in the ball-room<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDERELLA<|>SLIPPER<|>The glass slipper is used to identify Cinderella<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
