Appleton & Company\n\n1855\n \n\n \n \n \n\nCINDERELLA;\n\nOr,\n\nTHE LITTLE GLASS SLIPPER.\n\nHERE once lived a gentleman and his wife, who were the parents\nof a lovely little daughter.\nWhen this child was only nine years of age, her mother fell\nsick. Finding her death coming on, she called her child to her and\nsaid to her, \"My child, always be good; bear every thing that\nhappens to you with patience, and whatever evil and troubles you\nmay suffer, you will be happy in the end if you are so.\" Then the\npoor lady died, and her daughter was full of great grief at the\nloss of a mother so good and kind.\nThe father too was unhappy, but he sought to get rid of his\nsorrow by marrying another wife, and he looked out for some prudent\nlady who might be a second mother to his child, and a companion to\nhimself. His choice fell on a widow lady, of a proud and tyrannical\ntemper, who had two daughters by a former marriage, both as haughty\nand bad-tempered as their mother. No sooner was the wedding over,\nthan the step-mother began to show her bad temper. She could not\nbear her step-daughter's good qualities, that only showed up her\ndaughters' unamiable ones still more obviously, and she accordingly\ncompelled the poor girl to do all the drudgery of the household. It\nwas she who washed the dishes, and scrubbed down the stairs, and\npolished the floors in my lady's chamber and in those of the two\npert misses, her daughters; and while the latter slept on good\nfeather beds in elegant rooms, furnished with full-length\nlooking-glasses, their sister lay in a wretched garret on an old\nstraw mattress. Yet the poor thing bore this ill treatment very\nmeekly, and did not dare complain to her father, who thought so\nmuch of his wife that he would only have scolded her.\n\n\nWhen her work was done, she used to sit in the chimney-corner\namongst the cinders, which had caused the nickname of\nCinderella to be given her by the family; yet, for all her\nshabby clothes, Cinderella was a hundred times prettier than her\nsisters, let them be dressed ever so magnificently.\nThe poor little Cinder-wench! this harsh stepmother was a sore\ntrial to her; and how often, as she sate sadly by herself, did she\nfeel that there is no mother like our own, the dear parent whose\nflesh and blood we are, and who bears all our little cares and\nsorrows tenderly as in the apple of her eye!\nIt happened that the king's son gave a ball, to which he invited\nall the nobility; and, as our two young ladies made a great figure\nin the world, they were included in the list of invitations. So\nthey began to be very busy choosing what head-dress and which gown\nwould be the most becoming. Here was fresh work for poor\nCinderella: for it was she, forsooth, who was to starch and get up\ntheir ruffles, and iron all their fine linen; and nothing but dress\nwas talked about for days together. \"I,\" said the eldest, \"shall\nput on my red velvet dress, with my point-lace trimmings.\" \"And I,\"\nsaid the younger sister, \"shall wear my usual petticoat, but shall\nset it off with my gold brocaded train and my circlet of\ndiamonds.\"\n\nCINDERELLA DRESSING HER SISTER'S HAIR.\n\nThey sent for a clever tire-woman to prepare the double rows of\nquilling for their caps, and they purchased a quantity of\nfashionably cut patches. They called in Cinderella to take her\nadvice, as she had such good taste, and Cinderella not only advised\nthem well, but offered to dress their hair, which they were pleased\nto accept. While she was thus busied, the sisters said to her: \"And\npray, Cinderella, would you like to go to the ball?\"\n\"Nay, you are mocking me,\" replied the poor girl; \"it is not for\nsuch as I to go to balls.\" \"True enough,\" rejoined they;\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT GUTENBERG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Project Gutenberg is an online platform providing free access to ebooks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>Country where the ebook is accessible)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HENRY W.
