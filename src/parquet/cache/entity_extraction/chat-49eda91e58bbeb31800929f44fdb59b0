When this was over, the\nprince requested to have the honour of dancing with her. Cinderella\nsmiled consent; and the delighted prince immediately led her out to\nthe head of the dance, just about to commence. The eyes of the\nwhole company were fixed upon the beautiful pair.\nThe trumpets sounded and the music struck up, and the dance\ncommenced; but if Cinderella's beauty, elegant figure, and the\nsplendor of her dress, had before drawn the attention of the whole\nroom, the astonishment at her dancing was still greater.\nGracefulness seemed to play in all her motions; the airy\nlightness with which she floated along—as buoyant as\nthistle-down—drew forth a general murmur of admiration. The\nhall rang with the loudest acclamations of applause, and the\ncompany, all in one voice, pronounced her the most elegant creature\nthat had ever been seen. And this was the little girl who had\npassed a great part of her life in the kitchen, and had always been\ncalled a \"Cinder-wench.\"\nWhen the dance was ended, a magnificent feast was served up,\nconsisting of all delicacies: so much was the young prince engaged\nwith Cinderella, that he did not eat one morsel of the supper.\nCinderella drew near her sisters, and frequently spoke to them;\nand in her goodness of heart she offered them the delicacies which\nshe had received from the prince: but they did not know she was\ntheir sister.\nWhen Cinderella heard the clock strike three-quarters past\neleven, she made a low courtesy to the whole assembly and retired\nin haste.\nYou see how fortune befriends the good-hearted, and even out of\nsuch unpromising material as a pumpkin and mice, can make a coach\nand six, with which to honor her worthy favorite. So Cinderella\ngoes to the ball; but to teach her to be diligent and faithful in\nher engagements, her faëry godmother enjoins upon her that she\nreturn home at twelve. Native beauty and grace attract the princely\nheart; and while the king's son pays no heed to her pretentious\nsisters, he is all grace and condescension to little Cinderella.\nObedient to her engagement with her godmother, she returns in all\nthe splendor and honor of the coach and six.\nOn reaching home, she found her godmother; and after thanking\nher for the treat she had enjoyed, she ventured to express a wish\nto return to the ball on the following evening, as the prince had\nrequested her to do.\nShe was still relating to her godmother all that had happened at\ncourt, when her two sisters knocked at the door. Cinderella went\nand let them in, pretending to yawn and stretch herself, and rub\nher eyes, and saying, \"How late you are!\" just as if she was waked\nup out of a nap, though, truth to say, she had never felt less\ndisposed to sleep in her life. \"If you had been to the ball,\" said\none of the sisters, \"you would not have thought it late. There came\nthe most beautiful princess ever seen, who loaded us with polite\nattentions, and gave us oranges and citrons.\"\nCinderella could scarcely contain her delight, and inquired the\nname of the princess. But they replied that nobody knew her name,\nand that the king's son was in great trouble about her, and would\ngive the world to know who she could be. \"Is she, then, so very\nbeautiful?\" said Cinderella, smiling. \"Oh, my! how I should like to\nsee her! Oh, do, my Lady Javotte, lend me the yellow dress you wear\nevery day, that I may go to the ball and have a peep at this\nwonderful princess.\" \"A likely story, indeed!\" cried Javotte,\ntossing her head disdainfully, \"that I should lend my clothes to a\ndirty Cinderella like you!\"\nCinderella expected to be refused, and was not sorry for it, as\nshe would have been puzzled what to do, had her sister really lent\nher the dress she begged to have.\nOn the following evening the sisters again went to the court\nball, and so did Cinderella, dressed even more magnificently than\nbefore. The king's son never left her side, and kept paying her the\nmost flattering attentions. The young lady was nothing loth to\nlisten to him; so it came to pass that she forgot her godmother's\ninjunctions, and, indeed, lost her reckoning so completely, that\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
