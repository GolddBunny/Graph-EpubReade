While she was thus busied, the sisters said to her: \"And\npray, Cinderella, would you like to go to the ball?\"\n\"Nay, you are mocking me,\" replied the poor girl; \"it is not for\nsuch as I to go to balls.\" \"True enough,\" rejoined they; \"folks\nwould laugh to see a Cinderella at a court ball.\"\nThese two step-sisters were very cruel to Cinderella, and\nill-used her much. Ah! what sweet friends are our own born\nsisters!—there can be no substitutes like them in the whole\nwide world.\nAny other but Cinderella would have dressed their hair awry to\npunish them for their impertinence, but she was so good-natured\nthat she dressed them most becomingly. Although they disdained her,\nand while they would themselves make a great figure in the world,\nsought to degrade and lower her, see how the lovely disposition of\nCinderella shines out. Although she was not allowed to go to the\nball of the king's son, she not only advised them well how they\ncould array themselves to appear to the best advantage, but she\neven—what greatness of heart to do that!—with her own\nhands dresses their hair, and in the most becoming manner her\ndelicate taste can suggest.\nThe two sisters were so delighted, that they scarcely ate a\nmorsel for a couple of days. They spent their whole time before a\nlooking-glass, and they would be laced so tight, to make their\nwaists as slender as possible, that more than a dozen stay-laces\nwere broken in the attempt.\nThe long-wished-for evening came at last, and these proud misses\nstepped into the carriage and drove away to the palace. Cinderella\nlooked after the coach as far as she could see, and then returned\nto the kitchen in tears; where, for the first time, she bewailed\nher hard and cruel degradation. She continued sobbing in the corner\nof the chimney, until a rapping at the kitchen-door roused her, and\nshe got up to see what had occasioned, it. She found a little old\nbeggar-woman hobbling on crutches, who besought her to give her\nsome food. \"I have only part of my own supper for you, Goody, which\nis no better than a dry crust. But if you like to step in and warm\nyourself, you can do so, and welcome.\" \"Thank you, my dear,\" said\nthe old woman in a feeble, croaking voice. She then hobbled in and\ntook her seat by the fire.\n\"Hey! dearee me! what are all these tears, my child?\" said the\nold woman. And then Cinderella told the old woman all her griefs;\nhow her sisters had gone to the ball, and how she wished to go too,\nbut had no clothes, or means to do so.\n\"But you shall go, my darling,\" said the old woman, \"or I\nam not Queen of the Faëries or your Godmother. Dry up your\ntears like a good god-daughter and do as I bid you, and you shall\nhave clothes and horses finer than any one.\"\nCinderella had heard her father often talk of her godmother, and\ntell her that she was one of those good faëries who protect\nchildren. Her spirits revived, and she wiped away her tears.\nThe faëry took Cinderella by the hand, and said, \"Now, my\ndear, go into the garden and fetch me a pumpkin.\" Cinderella\nbounded lightly to execute her commands, and returned with one of\nthe finest and largest pumpkins she could meet with. It was as big\nas a beer barrel, and Cinderella trundled it into the kitchen,\nwondering what her godmother would do with it. Her godmother took\nthe pumpkin, and scooped out the inside of it, leaving nothing but\nrind; she then struck it with her wand, and it instantly became one\nof the most elegant gilt carriages ever seen.\nShe next sent Cinderella into the pantry for the mouse-trap,\nbidding her bring six little mice alive which she would find in the\ntrap. Cinderella hastened to the pantry, and there found the mice\nas the faëry had said, which she brought to the old lady, who\ntold her to lift up the door of the trap but a little way and very\ngently, so that only one of the mice might go out at a time.\nCinderella raised the mouse-trap door, and as the mice came out\none by one, the old woman touched them with her wand, and\ntransformed them into fine prancing dapple-gray carriage horses\nwith long manes and tails, which were tied up with light-blue\nribands.\n\"Now, my dear good child,\" said the faëry, \"here you have a\ncoach and horses, much handsomer than your sisters', to say the\nleast of them; but as we have neither a postilion nor a coachman to\ntake care of them, run quickly to the stable, where the rat-trap is\nplaced, and bring it to me.\"\nCinderella was full of joy, and did not lose a moment; and soon\nreturned with the trap, in which there were two fine large rats.\nThese, too, were touched with the wand, and immediately the one was\nchanged\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CINDERELLA<|>PERSON<|>Cinderella is a kind-hearted young woman who is mistreated by her step-sisters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEP-SISTERS<|>PERSON<|>The step-sisters are cruel to Cinderella and mistreat her)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAËRY<|>PERSON<|>The Faëry is Cinderella's godmother who helps her attend the ball)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARDEN<|>GEO<|>Location where Cinderella retrieves a pumpkin for her godmother)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUMPKIN<|>EVENT<|>The pumpkin is transformed into an elegant carriage by Cinderella's godmother)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PANTRY<|>GEO<|>Location where Cinderella finds mice for her godmother)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOUSE-TRAP<|>EVENT<|>The mouse-trap contains mice that are transformed into carriage horses by Cinderella's godmother)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STABLE<|>GEO<|>Location where Cinderella retrieves a rat-trap for her godmother)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAT-TRAP<|>EVENT<|>The rat-trap contains rats that are transformed into coachmen by Cinderella's godmother)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDERELLA<|>STEP-SISTERS<|>The step-sisters mistreat Cinderella<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDERELLA<|>FAËRY<|>The Faëry helps Cinderella attend the ball<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDERELLA<|>GARDEN<|>Cinderella retrieves a pumpkin from the garden<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDERELLA<|>PUMPKIN<|>Cinderella's godmother transforms the pumpkin into a carriage<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDERELLA<|>PANTRY<|>Cinderella finds mice in the pantry<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDERELLA<|>MOUSE-TRAP<|>Cinderella's godmother transforms mice into carriage horses<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDERELLA<|>STABLE<|>Cinderella retrieves a rat-trap from the stable<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDERELLA<|>RAT-TRAP<|>Cinderella's godmother transforms rats into coachmen<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
