Cinderella raised them, saying, as she\nembraced them, that she not only forgave them with all her heart,\nbut wished for their affection. She was then taken to the palace of\nthe young prince, in whose eyes she appeared yet more lovely than\nbefore, and who married her shortly after.\nCinderella, who was as good as she was beautiful, allowed her\nsisters to lodge in the palace, and gave them in marriage, that\nsame day, to two lords belonging to the court.\n\nMARRIAGE OF THE PRINCE AND CINDERELLA.\nThe amiable qualities of Cinderella were as conspicuous after as\nthey had been before marriage.\n \n\n \n\n\nThis series of FAIRY STORIES has for generations been listened\nto and read by Children with an inexpressible delight, which other\nbooks have failed to afford them.\nThe extravagance of the Stories—the attractive manner of\ntelling them—the picturesque scenery described—the\nmarvellous deeds related—the reward of virtue and punishment\nof vice, upon principles strictly in accordance with ethical laws,\nas applied to the formation of character, render them peculiarly\nadapted to induce children to acquire a love for reading, and to\naid them to cultivate the affections, sympathies, fancy, and\nimagination.\nThe principle, that good examples only should be imitated, has\nbeen lost sight of in the Pictorial embellishment of these standard\nFairy Stories, upon the assumption that indifferent pictures are\ngood enough to give first impressions of Art to Children. If this\nholds true then language and morals of a questionable cast will\nsubserve the same ends; but the fallacy of this dogma\nnotwithstanding, no one upon reflection will deny.\nThat this edition of these Stories may be more perfect than any\nother extant, the publisher has embellished it with exquisite\nspecimens of high Pictorial Art, from which Children may derive\nthose correct ideas that will mature into the beautiful and\ngrand.\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CINDERELLA ***\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.
