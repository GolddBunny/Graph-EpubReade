Another touch of the wonderful wand soon converted them\ninto six spruce footmen in dashing liveries, with powdered hair and\npig-tails, three-cornered cocked hats and gold-headed canes, who\nimmediately jumped up behind the carriage as nimbly as if they had\nbeen footmen and nothing else all their lives.\nThe coachman and postilion having likewise taken their places,\nthe faëry said to Cinderella, \"Well, my dear girl, is not this\nas fine an equipage as you could desire to go to the ball with?\nTell me, now, are you pleased with it?\"\n\"O yes, dear godmother,\" replied Cinderella; and then, with a\ngood deal of hesitation, added, \"but how can I make my appearance\namong so many finely-dressed people in these mean-looking\nclothes?\"\n\"Give yourself no uneasiness about that, my dear; the most\nlaborious part of our task is already accomplished, and it will be\nhard if I cannot make your dress correspond with your coach and\nservants.\"\nOn saying this, the old woman, assuming her character of Queen\nof the Faëries, touched Cinderella with the magic wand, and\nher clothes were instantly changed into a most magnificent ball\ndress, ornamented with the most costly jewels. The faëry took\nfrom her pocket a beautiful pair of elastic glass slippers, which\nshe caused Cinderella to put on, and then desired her to get into\nthe carriage with all expedition, as the ball had already\ncommenced.\nTwo footmen opened the carriage door, and assisted the now\nbeautifully dressed Cinderella into it. Her godmother, before she\ntook leave, strictly charged her, on no account whatever to stay at\nthe ball after the clock had struck twelve; and then added, that if\nshe stopped but a single moment beyond that time, her fine coach,\nhorses, coachman, postilion, and footmen, and fine apparel, would\nall return to their original shapes of pumpkin, mice, rats,\nlizards, and mean-looking clothes.\nCinderella promised faithfully to attend to every thing that the\nfaëry had mentioned; and then, quite overjoyed, gave the\ndirection to the footman, who bawled out in a loud and commanding\ntone to the coachman, \"To the Royal Palace.\" The coachman touched\nhis prancing horses lightly with his whip, and swiftly the carriage\nstarted off, and in a short time reached the palace.\n\n\nCINDERELLA'S ARRIVAL AT THE PALACE IN HER ELEGANT GILT\nCARRIAGE, WHICH ATTRACTS GENERAL NOTICE AS IT DRIVES UP TO THE\nMARBLE PORTICO; OF WHICH INFORMATION IS COMMUNICATED TO THE PRINCE,\nWHO HASTENS TO THE DOOR AND WELCOMES CINDERELLA, HANDS HER OUT OF\nTHE CARRIAGE, AND GRACEFULLY LEADS HER INTO THE PALACE, WHERE THE\nNOBLES WELCOME HER AS A PRINCESS.\nThe arrival of so splendid an equipage as Cinderella's could not\nfail to attract general notice at the palace gates; and as it drove\nup to the marble portico, the servants in great numbers came out to\nsee it.
